What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Creates a .git file, to track changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Sort of a temp folder, don't know that it offers a real value other than another check point.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
See what's in the staging area before committing, delete files if need be.
