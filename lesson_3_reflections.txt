When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When sharing the work, working remotely.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Only pull when ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: clone on github; clones: download or copy repository locally; branches: splitting project into two streams.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can study it before merging.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Send files by email, open communication, small teams. Small projects would be easier, large projects impossible.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When you want to clean up branch before merging. Benefit is cleaner code, though more steps.
