What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manual allows logical break points, but you may lose work to unexpected crash.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Programming files are more closely linked than a normal google doc file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log to see all commits, git diff to see what's different in two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It's like a backup that always works.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Try downloading other peoples code, version control
